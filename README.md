SoundDart
=========
SoundDart is a Command-line SoundSprite generator for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

It requires the wonderful [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to be in your PATH.  Thanks to [unscripted](https://github.com/seaneagan/unscripted) for simplifying command-line app creation and [audiosprite.js](https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite) for inspiration.

##What's a SoundSprite?##
Just like sprite sheets for graphics, a SoundSprite is comprised of several sounds, stitched together in a single compressed file. This allows for fewer HTTP Requests / deployed assets in your project. A configurable silence gap is placed between each sound (to help prevent loose Audio APIs from running into other sounds) and since Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding is available for most formats, there is little file size penalty.

##How do I use SoundDart?##
SoundDart is run on the command-line, using the [DartVM](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dart-vm/) like so:

`dart path/to/sounddart.dart`

Passing no options will provide a familiar help block:

```
Combines uncompressed sound files, encodes to popular formats, and generates json atlas.

Usage:

dart sounddart.dart [options] files...

Options:

-h, --help          Print this usage information.
-o, --output        Filename for the output file(s), without extension.
                    (defaults to "output")

-e, --export        Limit exported file types. eg "mp3,ogg"
                    (defaults to "")

-r, --samplerate    Sample rate.
                    (defaults to "44100")

-c, --channels      Number of channels (1=mono, 2=stereo).
                    (defaults to "1")

-g, --gap           Length of gap in seconds.
                    (defaults to ".25")

-v, --verbose       Be super chatty.

Examples:

dart sounddart.dart -o audio *.wav # wildcard expansion supported even if your shell doesn't
dart sounddart.dart -e "mp3,ogg" *.wav # only export mp3 and ogg formats
```

SoundDart will then chain all of your sounds together and output SoundSprites in several formats (mp3, ogg, opus, m4a) and a .json atlas (currently supports the format used by [StageXL](http://www.stagexl.org) and [Howler.js](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library)) in your current working directory:
